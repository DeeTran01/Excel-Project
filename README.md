## 📂 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze **cookie sales data** in order to uncover insights and trends. The dataset includes various details about sales transactions, including cookie types, quantities sold, and sales figures. Using Excel, the data was cleaned, filtered, and analyzed to create meaningful reports and visual representations. 💼

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation

- **Cleaning:** The dataset was initially raw and required cleaning to ensure consistency and accuracy. This involved:
  - 🚫 Removing duplicates
  - 🔄 Filling or removing missing data points
  - 🔧 Standardizing column formats for ease of analysis

- **Filtering:** I filtered the data based on specific criteria (e.g., sales over a certain amount, or specific date ranges) to focus on the most relevant transactions. 🔍

- **Formatting:** Applied appropriate formatting to columns (currency, date formats, etc.) for readability and ease of use. ✨

## 📈 Analysis and Calculations

- **Formulas:** Utilized Excel's built-in formulas to perform essential calculations, such as:
  - 💰 Total sales per transaction
  - 📊 Sales averages and percentages
  - 💹 Profit margins (if applicable)
  
- **Pivot Tables:** Created pivot tables to summarize key metrics, such as:
  - 🍪 Total sales by cookie type
  - 🗓️ Sales performance by month or region (if applicable)

## 📊 Visualizations

To help interpret the data, I created the following three visuals in Excel:

1. **📅 Sales Trend Over Time:** A line chart showing the sales trends across different periods (e.g., months, quarters).

3. **🍪 Sales Distribution by Cookie Type:** A bar chart that illustrates the sales distribution by different cookie types.

4. **💸 Profit Margins Analysis:** A pie chart representing the proportion of profit margins for various cookie types.

These visualizations provide a clear overview of sales trends, product performance, and profit distribution. 📉

## 💻 Technologies Used
